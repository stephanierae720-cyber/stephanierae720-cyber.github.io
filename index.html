    <h2>Texas Tech University Online+ Student, B.A., Interdisciplinary Studies minoring in Computer Applications, Organizational Leadership and Integrative Studies. 10 years of Banking & Payment Processing experience, with plans to pivot into teaching/education following graduation from TTU Online+.</h2>

    <h3>Goals for this Course:</h3>
    <p>1. A better understanding of programming & development languages, and how the different components work together to build complete websites and other digital applications. I expect to master the process for managing web-based projects and be able to apply those skills professionally in my future career endeavors as well as in personal side projects.      
    <p>2. What it means to be a project manager, from a high-level at least; In my career thus far I have overseen a few larger-scale projects but lacked the formal education. I am looking forward to reflecting on past projects and seeing how I may have done things differently/better. 
    <p>3. How this course material will coincide with what I'm learning in my other courses this session which are Critical Thinking in Leadership and Leadership Practice and Development.</p>
